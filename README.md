This project was developed for the UoL Final Project module. The template used was for a physics based game. The project is therefore an 
anti-gravity high-speed arcade racing game. The project was developed in Unity 2022.3.30f1.

Best played with controller, although keyboard and mouse player controls can also be used. Control scheme and game mode objectives 
can be viewed in-game. Hope you enjoy!
